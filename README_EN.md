- 🌍 Cross-Platform: Support for Windows, Linux, macOS, and other major operating systems
- 🎯 Smart Detection: Automatic identification of various information leak types
- 📦 Ready to Use: No complex environment configuration required
- 🔄 Concurrent Processing: Support for batch scanning of multiple targets
- 🛡️ Reliable: Enhanced error tolerance and stability

### 🎯 Use Cases

- `.git` source code leakage
- `.svn` source code leakage
- `.DS_Store` information leakage
- Directory listing exposure

## 🚀 Quick Start
